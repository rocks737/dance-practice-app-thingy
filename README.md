# dance-practice-app-thingy

Frontend + Supabase playground for the dance practice partner matcher.

## Where did the Java backend go?

There isn’t one anymore. The previous Spring Boot/Gradle stack has been removed so we don’t confuse people (or AI assistants) into thinking there’s an API to run. The `backend/` folder now only contains **reference-only JPA entities/enums** that document the Supabase schema.

- ✅ Safe to open/read to understand relationships, column names, soft-delete patterns, etc.
- ❌ Not runnable—no Gradle wrapper, Dockerfile, controllers, or services exist here.
- 📝 Each Java file includes a comment reminding future readers that Supabase is the real backend.

If you need executable code, copy the entities into your own project or inspect the Supabase migrations instead.

## Frontend

The frontend is a Next.js app using the Basejump starter kit, configured for Supabase authentication and account management.

### Running locally

```bash
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your Supabase credentials:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://ycouamhfhambbfcakkqo.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Deploying to Vercel

```bash
cd frontend
vercel --prod
```

Or connect via GitHub: push your repo and import it in the Vercel dashboard. Add the environment variables in Project Settings → Environment Variables.

### Designer Preview

A dedicated page for designers to preview and customize all UI components without authentication:

**Access:** `http://localhost:3000/designer-preview`

**Features:**
- 🎨 Live theme editor with real-time color customization
- 🌓 Dark/light mode testing
- 📦 Complete component library showcase
- 💾 Export theme as CSS (copy or download)
- 🎯 Preset themes (Ocean, Sunset, Forest, Royal)

Perfect for:
- Design collaboration
- Theme customization
- Component previewing
- Accessibility testing

See `frontend/src/app/designer-preview/README.md` for detailed documentation.

### Mobile Optimization

The entire frontend is optimized for mobile web (portrait mode) and ready to be wrapped in a mobile app:

**Features:**
- 📱 Responsive design for all screen sizes (375px+)
- 🍔 Mobile hamburger menu with slide-out drawer
- 👆 Touch-friendly buttons and interactions
- 📏 Proper viewport and meta tags configured
- 🌓 Dark mode fully supported on mobile
- ⚡ Fast, smooth mobile experience

**Ready for:**
- Mobile web browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome, etc.)
- React Native / Expo wrapping
- Capacitor / Ionic wrapping
- Progressive Web App (PWA)

See `docs/MOBILE_OPTIMIZATION.md` for complete details.

## Supabase CLI & schema export

- Install/update the CLI locally:

  ```bash
  npm install supabase --save-dev
  npx supabase --version
  ```

- Boot the local stack and apply every migration in `supabase/migrations`:

  ```bash
  supabase start
  supabase db reset
  ```

- Push new migrations to the hosted project (ref `ycouamhfhambbfcakkqo`) when you’re ready:

  ```bash
  npx supabase login
  supabase db push
  ```

That’s it—no JVM build, no schema-export profile, no Docker Compose backend. Supabase is the source of truth for data + auth.

## User Profile Auto-Creation

User profiles are **automatically created at the API layer** on first login after authentication. This happens in the Next.js middleware (`src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts`).

New users automatically get:
- ✅ A `user_profiles` record linked to their auth account
- ✅ Default DANCER role
- ✅ Default settings (INTERMEDIATE skill, LEADER role, profile visible)

### Why API Layer vs Database Trigger?

We moved profile creation from database triggers to the application layer for:
- ✨ Better control over onboarding flows
- ✨ Easier to customize and validate
- ✨ Simpler to add business logic
- ✨ Future-proof for custom onboarding workflows

### Adding Roles

To add additional roles (ADMIN, INSTRUCTOR, ORGANIZER):

```sql
-- Add ADMIN role to a user
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role)
SELECT id, 'ADMIN'
FROM user_profiles
WHERE email = 'user@example.com'
ON CONFLICT (user_id, role) DO NOTHING;
```

### Backfilling Existing Users

If you have auth users without profiles, use:

```bash
# Run the backfill script
npx supabase db execute -f supabase/migrations/helpers/backfill_steve_profile.sql

# Or manually in SQL editor:
# See supabase/migrations/helpers/create_existing_user_profiles.sql
```
